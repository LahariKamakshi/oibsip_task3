We have all come across ATMs in our cities and it is built on Java. This complex project consists of five different classes and is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is first requested to register providing details like name, password etc. After this the user is requested to login with the user name and password. On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. 
The project allows to perform following operations:

1. Withdraw
2. Deposit
3. Transfer
4. Check balance
5. Transaction History
6. Exit
